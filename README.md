# wireframing

The most basic definition of wireframing would be that it is a way to design a piece of software at th structural level.  
It refers to the act of outlining the basic structure and layout without delving into the detailed design elements like colors, fonts and images.  
A wireframe (a product of wireframing) is used in the early stages of development to establish layout and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.  

## Importance of wireframing in the design process

- Help to translate abstract ideas to tangible presentations that can then be showed to stakeholders before the creative process gets underway.
- Wireframes are quicker and cheaper to review as compared to high fidelity designs.
- Wireframes help to identify potential usability issues early on due to the focus on the user interface structure.
- Helps to detect design and usability issues early on due to the focus on the user interface structure.
- Wireframes act as a guide for subsequent design and development phases ensuring that the product remains aligned with the initial vision.
- The wireframs allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience ensuring a product is intuitive and user friendly.

## Key elements found in a wireframe

Some of the common elements of a wirefram are:

- Layout structure: This defines how the elements arranged on the page. Examples in a listings page would include a section set aside for the header, content and the footer.
- Navigation: This element details how users will move through the application. This includes a system of links or menu options that guide users to the most important sections of the application.
- Content placement: This indicates where text, images and other content types will be place. It may also include buttons or links prompting users to take specific actions.
- Functionality: This outlines key functionalities and interactions

## Types of wireframes

There are two types of wireframes i.e:

### Low-fidelity wireframes

Are simple sketches or basic digital layouts that focus on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.  
They often look rough and use placeholders.  
They are often used in the early stages of the design process during brainstorming or ideation sessions  and are very helpful for quick iteration and feedback loops.

### High-fidelity wireframes

Are detailed and polished representations of the final design and often include accurate layout, typography, color schemes and sometimes interactivity.
They are often used to demonstrate how  the final product will look.  
They also serve as a reference for developers during implementation.  

The type of wirefram in this case is a high-dielity wireframe. It has a more specific layout, typography and resembles the final product.
