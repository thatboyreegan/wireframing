# wireframing

The most basic definition of wireframing would be that it is a way to design a piece of software at th structural level.  
It refers to the act of outlining the basic structure and layout without delving into the detailed design elements like colors, fonts and images.  
A wireframe (a product of wireframing) is used in the early stages of development to establish layout and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.  

## Importance of wireframing in the design process

- Help to translate abstract ideas to tangible presentations that can then be showed to stakeholders before the creative process gets underway.
- Wireframes are quicker and cheaper to review as compared to high fidelity designs.
- Wireframes help to identify potential usability issues early on due to the focus on the user interface structure.
- Helps to detect design and usability issues early on due to the focus on the user interface structure.
- Wireframes act as a guide for subsequent design and development phases ensuring that the product remains aligned with the initial vision.
- The wireframs allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience ensuring a product is intuitive and user friendly.

## Key elements found in a wireframe

Some of the common elements of a wirefram are:

- Layout structure: This defines how the elements arranged on the page. Examples in a listings page would include a section set aside for the header, content and the footer.
- Navigation: This element details how users will move through the application. This includes a system of links or menu options that guide users to the most important sections of the application.
- Content placement: This indicates where text, images and other content types will be place. It may also include buttons or links prompting users to take specific actions.
- Functionality: This outlines key functionalities and interactions

## Types of wireframes

There are two types of wireframes i.e:

### Low-fidelity wireframes

Are simple sketches or basic digital layouts that focus on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.  
They often look rough and use placeholders.  
They are often used in the early stages of the design process during brainstorming or ideation sessions  and are very helpful for quick iteration and feedback loops.

### High-fidelity wireframes

Are detailed and polished representations of the final design and often include accurate layout, typography, color schemes and sometimes interactivity.
They are often used to demonstrate how  the final product will look.  
They also serve as a reference for developers during implementation.  

The type of wirefram in this case is a high-dielity wireframe. It has a more specific layout, typography and resembles the final product.

## Popular wireframing tools

### Balsamiq

This is regarded as the best for brainstorming and simple wireframes.  
It has an intuitive, drag and rop feature which also makes it suitable for non-designers.  
It focuses on low-fidelity wireframing to prioritize functionality and structure over aesthetics.  

### Figma (recommended)

Regarded as most suitable for teams that want an all-in-one tool for wireframing, prototyping and design.

### Adobe XD

Suitable for designers already using Adobe's ecosystem and needing a robust design and prototyping tool.  
As such it offers seamless intergration adobe products like photoshop and illustrator.  
Suitable for both wireframing and creation of high-fidelity mockups.  

### Axure RP

Preferred for projects requiring detailed functionality and interaction design.  
Allows for deatiled documentation alongside the wireframes.  
Also allows for advanced prototyping as well as dynamic content and conditional logic.  

### Whimsical

Suitable for quick and collaborative low-fidelity wireframing.  
Had built-in components for faster layout creation.
Combines flowcharting and wireframing in one tool.

### Lucidechart

Suitable for teams that are already using diagramming tools who need basic wireframing capabilities.  
Allows for easy collaboration and sharing of features.  
Easy intergration with tools like google drive, slack and Atlassian.

### Sketch

For mac users focused on high-fidelity design with scalability.  
It is regarded as the industry standard for high-fidelity wireframes and UI design.  
Offers reusable components and design systems for consistency.  

## Benefits of wireframing from a software development perspective

- Wireframes allow for teams to test and refine ideas before sigificant development begins.
- Wireframing acts as a central point of discussion for stakeholders, designers and developers. This aids in fostering a collaborative environment.
- Provides developers with a clear blueprint of page structure, layout and functionality. This helps to improve eficiency in coding and ensures consistency with design goals.
- Wireframing focuses on user experience by defining navigation flows, content placement and key interactions. This results in  product that is more intuitive and user firendly.
- Wireframes are quick to create and update, aligning well with iterative and incremental development processes.

## Real-world scenario where wireframing identified potential usability issues

I was part of team of three that was tasked with developing a web application(e-commerce) for a small scale baked goods retailer.
The project aimed to include standard features like product browsing, filtering, a shopping cart, and checkout functionality. The team decided to wireframe the user interface before starting development to align on the design and functionality.

The team created low-fidelity wireframes for key pages, including:

    - Homepage
    - Product listing page
    - Product detail page
    - Checkout flow

Issues identified before the production process started included:   An issue with the filtering system ie on the basis of color, size and price range. The filters were hidden in a collapsible side bar and users were not able to notice them.
The users were also confused by ambiguous buttons like "Proceed" on the checkout page, unsure if it meant "Go to Payment" or "Review Order."
Users struggled to navigate the multi-step checkout process because there was no clear indicator of progress.
Wireframes for mobile devices revealed that the product grid layout was difficult to navigate on smaller screens.

Solutions to thehose issues were:  

We redesigned the filters to be more prominent, moving them to a horizontal bar above the product listings.  
We updated the CTAs to be more descriptive, e.g., "Go to Payment" and "Review Order."  
We used tabs to separate product details, reviews, and size guides, improving readability.  
A progress bar was added to guide users through the steps.  
We optimized the mobile layout, displaying fewer products per row and adding a sticky filter button for easy access.  

The issues identified during wireframing led to significant design changes, saving time and resources. If these problems had been discovered during development, they would have required costly rework.  

In conclusion, wireframing is an essential tool for creating designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-centric. It ensures that projects start with a strong foundation, reducing risks and paving the way for successful, user-friendly solutions.
